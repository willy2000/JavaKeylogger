# Java Keylogger 
## Description
A simple implementation of a keylogger in Java. It is usable on Windows and with a german keyboard. This was part of a project for my Cybersecurity class in university. 
The implementation is not 100% complete (some keys could be missing) but it should be good enough to get an idea about keylogger.
## Requirements
- Windows System (not tested on a Unix system yet)
- Keyboard with german layout
- RethinkDB to get the keystrokes (including the Java library)
- JNativeHook library
